Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they
lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We
have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves
drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.

We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures. Each owner
transfers the coin to the next by digitally signing a hash of the previous
transaction and the public key of the next owner and adding these to the end of
the coin. A payee can verify the signatures to verify the chain of ownership.

Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is
predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value
per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users
increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage
of the increasing value.

The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If
the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above
cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. At the same time,
the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of
generating towards the price.
